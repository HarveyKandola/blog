I recently came across a old video of Steve Jobs talking about building
a powerful brand. It was a good follow-up to quotes I had seen made by
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff.

As a software/startup founder, there were some profound moments.

We still like to talk about product and what we do because leading with 
why we exist seems unnatural.

There is research that states customers seem to think that vendor offerings are generally the same. 
Software vendors on the other hand seem to think their product is better than the competition. 
Better in terms of capabilities, speed, quality and maybe price -- facts if you will.

We cannot own these "facts" because any capable vendor will simply replicate the features,
up performance, improve quality and price-to-match. 
So what's the difference now from the customer's perspective?

The focus should be around differentiation by owning and communicating our brand. 

*Who is X and what is it that they stand for?*

This is a much harder proposition for competitors to deal with.
