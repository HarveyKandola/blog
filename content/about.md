I'm an old school Software Developer, CTO by trade, who gave up the rat race to 
build software startups. Have a passion for enterprise software, B2B,
self-service bottom-up go-to-market models.

* Founder & CEO @ [Documize](https://documize.com)
* Founded [Countersoft](https://www.countersoft.com)

My pet theory at the moment is that a combination of open source core mixed with
the [Flyweel Model.](http://tomtunguz.com/saas-innovators-solution/) can yield
special results. Let's see.
